Lenovo X230
====

For the Thinkpad x230 there are two boards in `./boards`, x230-flash and x230.
 x230-flash is externally flashable and contains a smaller package that will
 let us boot to the Heads recovery shell. x230 is only internally flashable and
 contains all of Heads. Since we will end up using both x230-flash and x230, it
 makes the most sense to build both now.

Initial SPI2 (4MB) flash chip
-----

x230 boards needs their 4MB SPI2 to be initially externally flashed,
 while the 12MB rom needs to be flashed internally from within Heads to make
 sure to not screw up with ME, contained in the SPI1 flash (8MB bottom flash
 chip under keyboard)

The following make command generates a self-contained, externally flashable rom
 for the SPI2 (4MB BIOS, top SPI flash under keyboard).

```Makefile
make BOARD=x230-flash
```

Resulting rom is found under build/x230-flash/x230-flash.rom

Subsequent flashing (upgrades)
-----

The following make command will generate a 12MB `coreboot.rom` under the
build/x230 directory.

```Makefile
make BOARD=x230
```

The `coreboot.rom` is the one needed to flash rom updates from within Heads in
respect of ME. This is done with the help of the `flashrom-x230.sh` script from
Heads recovery shell.
